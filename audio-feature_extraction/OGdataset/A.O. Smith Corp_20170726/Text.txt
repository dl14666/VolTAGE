Thanks, Ajita
Sales for the second quarter of $738 million were 11% higher than the previous year
Net earnings in the second quarter of $92 million increased 6% from 2016. Second quarter earnings per share of $0.53 increased 8% compared with 2016. Sales in our North America segment of $471 million increased 9% compared with the second quarter of 2016. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of commercial water heaters and boilers in the U.S
and pricing actions in August 2016 related to steel cost increases and inflationary pressure on other costs
Aquasana, acquired in August of 2016, added $13 million to our North America segment sales
Rest of World segment sales of $273 million increased 14% compared with 2016. China sales increased 20% in local currency, driven by higher demand for our consumer products in the region, led by water treatment and air purification products, and pricing actions due to higher steel and other costs, which were announced earlier this year
On slide 6, North America segment earnings of $109 million were 5% higher than segment earnings in the prior year
The favorable impact from higher sales of commercial water heaters and boilers and the pricing actions in the U.S
were partially offset by significantly higher steel costs
Second quarter segment margin declined to 23.2% from 24.1% one year ago due to higher steel costs
The margin on our Aquasana products is lower than the segment average, which also contributed to the margin decline
Rest of World earnings of $32.5 million were essentially the same as one year ago
Higher China sales, including the price increase, were more than offset by higher steel costs, increased selling, general and administrative expenses and a less profitable sales mix in China
Advertising to support brand building and expansion of water treatment and air purification retail outlets in Tier 2 and 3 cities were the primary drivers of higher SG&A in China
Currency translation reduced China earnings by approximately $2 million compared with the prior year
As a result of these factors, second quarter segment margin was 11.9% compared with 13.8% last year
Our corporate expenses were essentially the same as one year ago
Our effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2017 was 27.8%
The rate was lower than the 29.8% experienced during the second quarter last year, primarily due to lower state income taxes and a change in geographic earnings mix
The lower effective tax rate this year compared with the effective rate one year ago benefited 2017 results by $0.01 per share
Cash provided by operations during the first half of 2017 was $73 million compared with $155 million provided during the prior year
Higher earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital
These factors resulted in lower cash flow in 2017. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remained strong
Our debt-to-capital ratio was 19% at the end of the second quarter
We have cash balances totaling $741 million located offshore, and our net cash position was approximately $366 million at the end of the quarter
During the first half of 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock for a total of $66 million
Approximately 3.6 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of June
This morning, we increased the midpoint of our 2017 EPS guidance by $0.03 per share with a range of between $2.07 and $2.11 per share
The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 13% increase in EPS compared with our 2016 results
Please turn to slide 9 for several 2017 assumptions
We expect our cash flow from operations in 2017 to be approximately $375 million, which is lower than the $447 million generated in 2016. We expect higher earnings in 2017, but also larger outlays for working capital due to the higher-than-anticipated cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2016. Over the two-year period from 2016 to 2017, we expect to generate operating cash of approximately $825 million, which compares with $612 million during 2014 to 2015. We broke ground in 2016 on the construction of the new water treatment and air purification manufacturing facility in Nanjing to support the strong growth of these products in China
Our 2017 capital spending plans of approximately $100 million includes $45 million related to this plant
Total costs for the facility, which is expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2018, will be about $65 million
After this expansion, we expect capital spending in 2018 and beyond to be at levels equal to our depreciation plus amortization
Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2017. As previously discussed, expenses related to our ERP implementation were $25 million in 2016 and are projected to decline to approximately $19 million in 2017. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2017, slightly higher than the $45 million in 2016, primarily due to higher expenses at our Corporate Technology Center and commissioned water treatment market studies
Take note that our interest expense will be approximately $3 million higher in 2017 as a result of higher rates, share repurchase activities and our acquisition last year
Our effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 28.5% in 2017, lower than the 29.4% rate in 2016. This assumption is predicated on no change to the current U.S
We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately $135 million in 2017 under a 10b5-1 plan
We may opportunistically repurchase additional shares up to $65 million
If $135 million of our stock is repurchased, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2017 will be approximately 174.5 million
I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for 2017 and our growth strategy beginning on slide 10. Ajita
Hi, Scott
I will tell you our steel prices have increased every quarter this year
And clearly compared to the prior years, they're up significantly from the prior year
So when we tear apart, for example, North America second quarter, the pricing could not offset the steel increases last year
I mean, the price increase last year did not offset the steel increases in the second quarter
However, as we talked about in our script, commercial water heaters was extremely strong for us in the quarter, as was commercial boilers
So, those were the contributors on why we had a net positive for the quarter
So, I don't know if that answers it, Scott, or not, but we've had continual increase in steel costs
Well, I'll take that Scott
When we put it in, there was an anticipation that steel prices, and we talked about it on the year-end call that we thought steel prices would level off and maybe decline
We haven't seen that at all, and they've continued to increase
So, I think that's part of the factor on why we're seeing what we're seeing is they continued to increase higher than what we put
Well, I'd say they weren't talked about because they were flat to the year, prior year
And you saw that certainly in the April and May data
And I'll tell you what we saw in June, it was the same
So, it was very flat with the prior year
And then, when you look, that's down a couple hundred thousand units from the first quarter
But I'll tell you, overall, we're pleased where the industry is
It's up almost 200,000 when you include tankless year-over-year
First quarter
Well, obviously, it depends where steel goes, but we would expect it will offset
